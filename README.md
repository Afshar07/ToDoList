# To Do List app using Vanilla JS
I wanted to learn to work with localStorage in Vanilla JS, So i created a simple page and add a little bit of style using Bootstrap 5.
At first i had some problems with the localStorage, but then i figured it out and now every task is stored in localStorage after adding to the task list.
* You can remove the tasks from the webpage and the localStorage using the clear button, but i'm gonna make it better and add a button to remove one task specifically.
This is just an basic App with little logic, since i'm learning vue, i can't put much time on this, but it's gonna be better soon ^_^

## Note to self
I wanted to make Blogr landing page responsive tonight (RN it's just work on desktops since i've done the desktop version first), but knowing that i don't understand localStorage was eating me alive, so i made this instead.
